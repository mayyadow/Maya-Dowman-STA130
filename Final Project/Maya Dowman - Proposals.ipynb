We will then subdivide the CONNECTION category into ‚Äúreal life‚Äù and ‚Äúonline‚Äù (real life being socializing with another person in a real life setting, while online will constitute socializing through online means such as text, phone call, video games, etc.). In our analysis of the variables, we can also subdivide the participants by whether they exhibit higher levels of online vs real life social interactions. We will then focus on the loneliness scales of each participant's response. By choosing these variables, we are able to focus on how different modes of connections with others interact with their loneliness scales. \n"
